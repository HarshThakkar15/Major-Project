My major project, WanderLust - inspired by Airbnb!

Utilizing the MVC architecture, I built WanderLust from scratch using:
- EJS for templating
- JavaScript for dynamic interactions
- CSS for visually appealing design
- HTML for structured content
- Node.js for server-side logic

Features include:
- User authentication and authorization
- User profiles and reviews
